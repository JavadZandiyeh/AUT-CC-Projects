AUT Cloud Computing Course Projects
## Project 1
This project was implemented to use multiple services and create the required service. Rather than implementing all our required services, we can use implemented services and integrate them into our project. Also, this project contains multiple services, and micro-service techniques were used on it.
- Service 1: contains APIs for user interaction
- Service 2: create jobs that need to be executed
- Service 3: run jobs that were executed by Service 2

## Project 2
This project contains three parts. 
- Part 1: Introduction to Dockerfile
- Part 2: Implementing an API and dockerize it
- Part 3: Manage docker containers by Kubernetes

## Project 3
We have an extensive dataset of tweets. These tweets are for the US election. Some map-reduce tasks have been performed on these tweets using Hadoop.
- Task 1: Finding the number of likes, retweets, and source of each tweet for each candidate
- Task 2: Finding the proportion of tweets about each candidate in some States
- Task 3: Same as Task 2 but with latitude and longitude of States
